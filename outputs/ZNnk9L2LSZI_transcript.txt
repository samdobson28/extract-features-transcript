 Gramps. Gramps, what do I do? I've been trying to think of what Denny would want me to say to you. The kid was a hell of a dad, wasn't he? He sure had me beat. I remember the day that he quit the band. He just, he up and said, that's it. The time has come. I was surprised. I never really liked the way the band sounded, but I knew how important it was to him. And so I asked him, I said, why are you quitting? And he said, you make sacrifices for your kids. For your kids. He said that without even blinking. And that's why he quit the band. For daddy? For you. It was when he heard you play so well. I think that's when it clicked for him. Your incredible talent. He, he just, he couldn't believe it. And all he wanted to do was to give you more. So he quit the band. He sold his drum kit. And he bought you that cello. Sacrifice. That's what we do for the people that we love. And here's mine, Mia. I want you to live. I want that more than anything in this world. I want you to fight like hell to stay with us. But with everybody else gone, I know it might not be what you want. It might be too hard for you to keep fighting. So if you want to go, I want you to know it's okay. It's okay. I, I understand. Thank you. I understand. Gramps. Thank you.
